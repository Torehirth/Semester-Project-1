## Description
This is my semester project for the first semester of Front-End Development.
The website is responsive and engaging. It was designed for a children's museum, targeting kids aged 7-15 and families. It features a playful yet simple design, optimized for fast loading and accessibility (WCAG compliance). The website includes six pages: Home, Explore, Exhibitions, Events, Involvement, and Visit. Built using HTML and CSS (Flexbox), the project emphasizes clean code, SEO optimization, and a mobile-first approach.

This project taught me valuable lessons in project management, accessibility, and responsive design. I faced challenges, particularly with time constraints, but learned to prioritize effectively and focus on delivering a product that met the projectâ€™s core requirements.
